This is a small Discord bot made with discord.py, used on the guild HoQ, and guilds related to it

The source also contains a static build of ffmpeg used for playing audio, which has not been uploaded here.

Currently, the bot can:
* Set AFK messages,
* Show Google search results for images and gifs,
* Show information about a user,
* Show information about a guild (commonly called *server*),
* Carry out moderation functions, like kicking, banning, unbanning, warning users, etc.,
* Return edited and deleted messages,
* Search for xkcd comics, etc.

Future plans:
- [X] Create a systematic approach to handling slash commands
- [ ] Create a game of hangman
- [X] Implement a queue for music

The bot is not available publicly (owing to the limitations it still suffers from).
